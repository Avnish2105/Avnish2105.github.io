# Robotics  

I have been passionate about robotics since childhood, attending workshops in school and beyond. My real robotics journey started in the first year of my diploma at MIT Tech Team Robocon, where I joined as an electronics enthusiast. Over time, I expanded my knowledge and skills, particularly in ROS (Robot Operating System).
